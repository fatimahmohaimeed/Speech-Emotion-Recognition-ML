# Speech Emotion Recognition Machine Learning

Recognizing emotions in speech plays an important role in everyday life among people and influences their intelligent and rational decisions. The increased interest in recognizing the emotion of speech helps us to understand the feelings of others and has an important role in human interactions because it transmits the rational state of the person, and aims to understand the desired feelings. But recognizing feelings in speech is a very difficult problem, and the reason for this is that the effective emotional features extracted For the task are not clear.


Therefore, I aim in this project to discover emotions from sound and extract effective features that help in understanding emotions with accuracy.
